<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

- Career Day is an PWA developed with the intention of giving young kids and teens a place to seek furture careers. The app includes language and design that is comprehensive and easy to navigate. A user is able to search for careers by key words or salary ranges. They are given short and concise overviews of each career and also able to watch videos from experts in the feilds they are interested in. If they like what they see, they can save careers into their favorites list. 
- We decided to do a PWA for the given benefits of having a home screen icon that is convenient and popular for younger users (The site can also be viewed on desktop).

## Plans for this app:

We plan to add features that will allow users to...  
* make an account, and login
* search by location/region 
* connect with professionals
* add more career to the exsisting dataset 
* Enable push notifications
